What does it mean to me? Thinking for a good time, that I should do. If I could only tell you the real story, it could be interesting how is new life, how is a new challenge, and how is a new time for me to tell you?\n\nI choose this song Leaving Yesterday Behind because of si many things that were making me sad, making me depressed, making me cry a lot, making me weak, making me something unpleasant. All those memories kept on haunting me. Yes, we have no today if we had no yesterday, we have no tomorrow if we have no today. It must be going altogether as part of our life. I can't forget easily, either it is all about good or bad times. I easily can forgive but it is not easy to forget certain things that happened and may happen along the way.\n\nTo give me a New Time for me is another milestone I want to explore in everything. For me, I realized, it's never too late as long as my heartbeats are here. My mind is still fresh to decide for any decisions to be made after all.ü§îü§îü§îüôèüôèüôèüí™üí™üí™. To be stronger, face the truth and start to step up forward whatever mountains you have to pass by. Remember, we can't see the beauty around our life, we can not appreciate a good thing without passing the crooked mountain of our life.\n\nAnd this is my song for you all. I am heartily dedicated to all the members of the community and all music lovers.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tv4ZHshXP2c\n\n#### Lyrics: Leaving Yesterday Behind(by Keno)\n\nSince you left me, I never really tried\nTo put my life back where it should belong\nAnd I've always let the past gone by\nI'm realizing that it could be wrong\nBut now I fin'lly knew\nI had to let it go\nTo make way for a brighter tomorrow\n\nSo now I'm leavin' yesterday behind\nAnd fin'lly I've made up my mind\nSo let the mem'ries stay away\nAnd think about today\nI'm leavin' yesterday behind\n'Cause now I'll try to live my life once more\nThe way I did before\n\nSince I know that I never will forget\nThe memories that made my yesterday\nI will try not to let it interfere\nThe choices I will make along the way\n'Cause I'm not livin' in a world of fantasy\nI'm here now in the world of reality\n\nSo now I'm leavin' yesterday behind\nAnd fin'lly I've made up my mind\nSo let the mem'ries stay away\nAnd think about today\nI'm leavin' yesterday behind\n'Cause now I'll try to live my life once more\nThe way I did before\n\nI'm leavin' yesterday behind\nAnd fin'lly I've made up my mind\nSo let the mem'ries stay away\nAnd think about today\nI'm leavin' yesterday behind\n'Cause now I'll try to live my life once more\nJust the way I did before\n\nSource: Musixmatch\n[Source](keno leaving yesterday behind lyrics https://g.co/kgs/qsEsPi)\n<center>\n#### Thank you #hiveopenmic community, admin @cabelindsay @mipiano and all moderators.
